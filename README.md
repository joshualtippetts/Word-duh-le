# Word-duh-le

[My Notes](notes.md)

Word-duh-le is a word guessing game where the player has to guess the hidden 5-letter word. With every guess more information is gained as to what letters are included in this 5-letter word. The player has 6 guesses before they fail. The amount of guesses correlates with your final score, the lower the better. All scores are stored in a leaderboard with all your friends! Who can get the lowest score!

### Elevator pitch

Competative, quick, and skill-based. Word-duh-le is a brief strategy guessing game where the players try to guess a secret word within 6 guesses. The real key to this game is the idea that the lower the score the better you did, and that score is shared with all of your friends. Turning this game from casual to a competition as to who can get lower among all your friends. So whose the smartest?

### Design

Example walkthrough: John logs in with his username (John<3mom) and puts in his password. John has already been playing the game so he has friends and most of his friends have already played today's word-duh-le so they're already on the leaderboard. He then plays the game and gets a score of 4 today. The leaderboard places him in 4th with that score and the leaderboard gets updated for all his friends.

### Key features

- User login: This is so your profile can be shared and added among all your friends and also so you can keep a personal score online.
- Word Guessing Gameplay: This is the actual body of the game where the user has to guess the word within 6 guesses. All correctly placed letters will turn green to give hints. All incorrectly placed letters but letters still found in the word will turn yellow. Finally all letters that can't be found in the word will turn gray.
- Leaderboard: All scores will be place on the leaderboard with the lowest score being placed at the top.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses three HTML pages. One page for the user login, one for the actual Word-duh-le game, and the last for the leaderboard.
- **CSS** - Styling specifically on the game and leaderboard pages to make them look good. Also coloration and styling will also be applied to the guesses as the game goes on.
- **React** - Applies the logic to all the pages. Provides the login interface, the logic behind the Word-duh-le gameplay, displays the leaderboard, etc.
- **Service** - Submits final scores, retrieves leaderboard information, verifies and logs users into the accounts. Unable to store leaderboard information if the user isn't authenticated. 
- **DB/Login** - Stores user profiles along with all friend/leaderboard information. Also stores the word database so the secret word can be changed daily.
- **WebSocket** - After the user plays the game their score is placed on the leaderboard which updates all other users leaderboards.
